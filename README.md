# Survivor Bracket: the app

Survivor Bracket will help Survivor Fans keep track of their current season predictions and scores.  A user can log in and make a prediction for the current Season 37.  As the season progesses, an admin will update the database, with final results. Each week, a user can see their updated score by clicking on the Update Score button on the main page.  Using a message feature, users are able to send messages to each other and talk smack as the show progresses.  

This is my Front-End Capstone for Nashville Software School!  I hope you enjoy it!
